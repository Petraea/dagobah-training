## ![GATC Logo](../shared-images/AdminTraining2016-100.png)  Clouds?


**Cloud computing** ... is a model for enabling ubiquitous, **on-demand** access to a **shared pool** of configurable **computing resources** ... which can be **rapidly provisioned and released** with minimal management effort. Cloud computing and storage ... may be located far from the user â€“ ranging in distance from **across a city to across the world.** - Wikipedia, Cloud Computing.

## ![GATC Logo](../shared-images/AdminTraining2016-100.png)  Available Clouds
.large[
* Amazon Web Services
  * Pay-per-time/machine etc.
  * Reasonably priced, but keep an eye on the costs
  * Large range of machine (i.e., instance) types
  * Education grants
* OpenStack
  * Open source community project
  * NeCTAR in Australia, Jetstream in USA, CLIMB in UK, lots of others
  * Some free for researchers (NeCTAR, CLIMB), some with project grants (Jetstream)

## ![GATC Logo](../shared-images/AdminTraining2016-100.png)  Why Clouds?
.large[
* Elastic compute!
  * Can dynamically resource analyses
* No need to maintain the hardware
  * Provider takes on cost of hardware and maintenance
  * Cost is shared between all users
* Move the compute to the data
  * Data on East Coast?
  * Start compute there. Save on data transfer.

## ![GATC Logo](../shared-images/AdminTraining2016-100.png) Galaxy on the Cloud
.large[
* There are cloud images (VM blueprints) available
  * with Galaxy pre-installed
  * with different sets of tools installed
  * with access to reference data
  * for different clouds (AWS globally, Jetstream, NeCTAR, CLIMB etc.)
* You just need credentials for the cloud you want to "launch" on.
  * Credentials are generally strings
  * An access key and a secret key or username and password with project details
  * They are obtained from the cloud account admin page you want to use

## ![GATC Logo](../shared-images/AdminTraining2016-100.png)  CloudLaunch
.large[
* CloudLaunch is a system for launching Galaxy (and other applications) on cloud resources
  * Public servers available at [launch.usegalaxy.org](https://launch.usegalaxy.org) and [launch.genome.edu.au](https://launch.genome.edu.au)
  * You can also install and run your own
  * Fill in the credential details, choose a location and machine size
  * Press go!
* CloudLaunch will now provision you a computer in the cloud with Galaxy installed and ready to go.
  * Depending on your choices and availability you will also have access to reference data and various tools
  * It should only take 2-3 minutes for everything to be set up.

## ![GATC Logo](../shared-images/AdminTraining2016-100.png)  Launch Demo
.large[
* Launch a Galaxy on the Cloud in NeCTAR
  * Similar process to AWS (but free for me)
Today, we'll be using the all-new-still-in-beta CloudLaunch
  * [beta.launch.usegalaxy.org](beta.launch.usegalaxy.org)
  * [betalaunch.genome.edu.au](betalaunch.genome.edu.au)
* Walk through what is happening

.large[
* Cloud manager: middleware to control cloud clusters
* Can be used to control system and application services, such as Galaxy
* Can mount filesystems, dynamically add/remove worker nodes, start/stop services

.large[
* Your CloudMan instance is a single machine
  * It is the "Head node" of a cluster
* CloudMan can start "worker" nodes.
  * More cloud instances (of any size)
  * Automatically connects to file system
  * Are registered in Slurm setup
  * A node will take ~2-3 minutes to start and configure.

  * Zero-to-go in less than 10 minutes.
* Toolsets and reference sets can be tailored to suit needs
  * Will be discussed in architecture section

.large[
* Cloud instances are typically transient
  * Can be terminated and resources returned to the pool
* However, user data and cluster configuration can be persisted
  * Then can be attached to new instance when they start
* CloudMan stores an instance's set up in an object store container for persistence

## ![GATC Logo](../shared-images/AdminTraining2016-100.png) Looking to the future

.large[
* An all-new system is under development
* We already saw the new CloudLaunch
  * No longer Galaxy-only: any application and multiple clouds can be plugged in
* It is powered by CloudBridge
  * [http://cloudbridge.readthedocs.io/](http://cloudbridge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  * An abstraction layer for mature clouds
  * Will let the new version of CloudMan run on any cloud
  * Therefore, we can use our Galaxy images on any cloud
* New CloudMan is planned
  * Container-based so no/minimal building necessary per cloud
  * Powered by CloudBridge, so natively cross-cloud
