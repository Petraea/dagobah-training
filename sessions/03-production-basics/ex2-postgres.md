### Galaxy Administrators Course

# Connecting Galaxy to PostgreSQL - Exercise.

#### Authors: Nate Coraor. 2016

## Section 1 - Installation

**Part 1 - Install PostgreSQL**

Install PostgreSQL from apt. In the case of the training instances, it has already been installed. However, it can't hurt to try to install it anyway:

```console
$ sudo apt install postgresql
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
postgresql is already the newest version (9.5+173).
0 to upgrade, 0 to newly install, 0 to remove and 60 not to upgrade.
$
```

## Section 2 - Add PostgreSQL user and database

PostgreSQL maintains its own user database apart from the system user database. As such, we need to create a PostgreSQL user matching the system user we're logged in as - `galaxy`.  By default, PostgreSQL is configured to allow access for system users with matching PostgreSQL usernames once created. This is done with the PostgreSQL `createuser` command, and it must be run as the `postgres` user:

```console
$ sudo -Hu postgres createuser galaxy
```

Next, we need to create an empty database. Once a database exists, Galaxy will populate it. The `createdb` command creates a database, and we want to make sure to create it with the `galaxy` user as the owner:

```console
$ sudo -Hu postgres createdb -O galaxy galaxy
```

We've created a new database with the name `galaxy`.

## Section 3 - Configure Galaxy

Next, we need to configure Galaxy to use PostgreSQL. To do this, open up the Galaxy config file, `galaxy.ini`, in an editor as the galaxy user:

```console
$ sudo -u galaxy -e /srv/galaxy/config/galaxy.ini
```

Locate the line:

```ini
#database_connection = sqlite:///./database/universe.sqlite?isolation_level=IMMEDIATE
```

Uncomment it and change it to:

```ini
database_connection = postgresql:///galaxy?host=/var/run/postgresql
```

The `?host=/var/run/postgresql` portion of the database URI instructs the database connection layer to look for PostgreSQL's socket in the given directory (because by default, it looks in `/tmp`, and Debian/Ubuntu use a different path).

## Section 4 - Start Galaxy

If you're already running Galaxy, hit `CTRL+C` to stop it (or `sudo -Hu galaxy galaxy --stop-daemon` if running as a daemon) , then start it again with `sudo -Hu galaxy galaxy`. It will first fetch the `psycopg2` wheel, which is the python PostgreSQL library, and then proceed to populate the database as it did the first time with SQLite.

```console
$ sh run.sh
