# Deployment and Platform Options

## Scope

Big picture options for installing Galaxy, and which options we are going to cover this week, when, and how deeply.

Options to cover:
- Single server install
- Public Cloud (AWS or other)
- Private Cloud
- Cluster install on a cluster you control
- Cluster install on a shared resource
- Distributed / heterogenous

For each:
- Strengths and weaknesses (why pick each)
- Key decisions youâ€™ll need to make
- How deeply we will cover this option this week and when.
